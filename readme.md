# Notes on Seven languages in Seven weeks.

After letting it rot on my Kindle's virtual shelf for a number of years (I could easily check how many, let's call it 3), I started reading it a few weeks ago (let's call that 3 as well). I flew through the chapters on Ruby and learned lots of exciting idioms etc but a new year combined with traveling back and fourth between Amsterdam and London has interrupted my studies somewhat.

Not it's time to learn some Io. It seems to me that this would be much better achieved if I were to save my code examples and homework from the book with some notes for future reference. This will require storage of some text files with change tracking so that future me can look back on how my thoughts progressed over time. I hear there's an app for that...

So far, I've completed the Ruby tasks. Hopefully they're all saved, I'll check that later. I've also completed some of the Io tasks. The rest will be added as and when they are completed.
